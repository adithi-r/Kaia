  "description": "Kaia is a go-to Google Chrome extension to uncover the true sustainability of clothing and food items. By cutting through greenwashing tactics rampant in both industries, we provide users with transparent insights into a productâ€™s environmental impact. Our tool goes beyond surface-level assessments, delving deep into factors like production country laws to ensure fair worker treatment, material composition for biodegradability and recyclability, and the presence of sustainable fibers to gauge carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. We scrutinize brand ethics, product longevity, and organic status to combat fast fashion's detrimental effects. Kaia is your ally in making informed, sustainable choices that positively impact both you and the planet.",
